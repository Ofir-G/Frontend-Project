                    <h4>Relying on Window Light</h4>
                    <p>Many of us assume that the sunlight coming through our windows will be adequate for our
                        houseplant, and in some cases it is. However, light that passes through glass isn't as strong as
                        direct, outdoor sunlight. Also, unless you're growing in a greenhouse, its brightness will
                        change throughout the day depending on the dirction the window faces.</p>
                    <p>Other factors affecting the amount of sunlight coming through a window include the size of the
                        window, eaves and overhangs, and shading by trees and buildings. In winter, the sun is lower in
                        the sky so there may be more direct sun; however, the intensity is weaker than in summer, and
                        there are fewer hours of daylight.</p>
                    <p>Here are some terms used to describe a houseplant's light preferences and the window location
                        that might best suit it:</p>
                    <h4>Bright light with some direct sun</h4>
                    <p>In the northern hemisphere, the most sunlight will come into a south-facing window. However, the
                        brightness and duration will depend on the factors above. West-facing windows offer shade in the
                        morning, but direct sun in the afternoon. In summer, this is usually the hottest part of the
                        day, so plants will receive some extra heat, too.</p>
                    <h4>Bright, indirect light</h4>
                    <p>Sheer curtains will transform the intense sunlight of a south-facing or west-facing window into
                        the bright, indirect light favored by many houseplants. Another good location is an east-facing
                        window, which provides a few hours of morning sun, which tends to be less intense and produce
                        less heat than afternoon sun.</p>
                    <h4>Medium light</h4>
                    <p>As you move plants away from windows, the light intensity is lessened. Placing a medium-light
                        plant about five feet in from a south- or west-facing window should provide adequate light.</p>
                    <h4>Low light</h4>
                    <p>Interior walls and north windows are often low-light areas. The more windows you have, the
                        brighter your interior space will be. Note that plants described as "low light" generally
                        <em>tolerate</em> low light, but would grow more vigorously with medium light. And no living
                        plant will thrive in a very dark corner.

                        <p class="card-text">
                        <p>Anyone can pour water on a plant. But it takes time and experience to understand how plants
                            use water and the many variables that come into play. These include&nbsp;the type of
                            plant,&nbsp;its size, the soil texture, recent weather, sun exposure, time of day and time
                            of year. In short, watering your garden shouldn't be a rote task. The amount of water a
                            plant requires is constantly changing, so you need to be paying attention.</p>

                <div class="card card-body">

                    <p>As the great American horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey wrote in 1917, "the watering of
                        plants usually exhibits the skill, or the lack of it, of the gardener. It is a practice that
                        cannot be well explained in print." &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Said more simply, it takes in-the-garden experience to become a watering pro. You can get a
                        jump start by following these 7 best practices:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Water Where the Roots Are</strong></p>
                    <p>Focus the water at the soil level and keep applying it until the plant’s entire root ball is
                        thoroughly soaked. Remember that the roots are probably just as wide as the plant and may be
                        a foot or two deep.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Check the Soil Before Watering</strong></p>
                    <p>The best moisture meter is at the end of your hand. When the soil surface looks dry, probe
                        down a few inches to see if the soil is dry several inches down. If so, it’s time to water.
                        If not, wait a day.</p>

                            alt="how-to-water-your-plants-1.jpg"></p>
                    <p><strong>3. Water in the Morning</strong></p>
                    <p>The best time to water your plants is in the morning.&nbsp;This way, if the
                        leaves get wet, they have the entire day to dry out. It's much more difficult
                        for plant diseases to get a foothold when the foliage is dry. If you can't water
                        in the morning, evening is second best.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Water Slowly</strong></p>
                    <p>If the soil surface is dry, water may puddle or run off and not be absorbed. The
                        solution is to start slowly and gradually build up to a thorough soak. Once the
                        top few inches are moist, the water will be absorbed more easily.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Make Every Drop Count</strong></p>
                    <p>Use a watering wand, drip irrigation or soaker hoses to direct water right to the
                        root zone.&nbsp;Watering early or late in the day minimizes moisture loss due to
                        evaporation from the soil surface. Shielding plants from wind will also reduce
                        moisture loss.</p>

                            alt="how-to-water-your-plants-2.jpg"></p>
                    <div><strong>6. Don't Overwater</strong></div>
                    <p>Plants need oxygen as much as they need water. For most plants, it’s best to let the soil
                        surface dry out a bit between waterings. This is especially important with container
                        plants. It’s always best to water deeply and less frequently.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. Don’t Let Them&nbsp;Go Dry</strong></p>
                    <p>In the heat of the day, plants sometimes wilt&nbsp;to conserve moisture, but they should
                        perk up again when&nbsp;evening&nbsp;comes. If you allow the soil to get too dry, the
                        fine, hair-like projections on the ends of the roots&nbsp;may&nbsp;be damaged.&nbsp;When
                        plants have to regrow these root hairs, it saps&nbsp;energy&nbsp;that would otherwise be
                        going to&nbsp;flower and fruit production.</p>
                    <p><strong>8. Use Mulch to Conserve Moisture</strong></p>
                    <p>Covering the soil with a thin layer of organic mulch such as compost, shredded leaves,
                        shredded bark or pine needles, will help&nbsp;reduce evaporation and minimize runoff. If
                        the mulch is more than an inch thick, it can work against you by preventing moisture
                        from reaching the roots.</p>

                    <meta charset="utf-8">
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repotting your plants can&nbsp;sound tricky, but we have a few
                            tips to make it a success.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p>First things first: repotting does not necessarily mean changing&nbsp;a plant’s current planter,
                        but rather, changing its soil or<span>&nbsp;</span>potting mix. Fresh soil means new nutrients.
                        This is great news if you love your current planter, but if you’re looking to purchase a new one
                        that’s fine, too.&nbsp;If you are changing planters, try to keep the size no more than 2" larger
                        in diameter for tabletop planters, and no more than 4" larger in diameter for floor planters. If
                        you're repotting a very small plant, your new planter might only need to be an inch larger! The
                        size is important&nbsp;here because typically when we move our plants to a larger pot with more
                        soil, we will be inclined to water more often. A small plant + an oversized planter + lots of
                        soil +&nbsp;lots of water = accidentally killing with kindness. You do not want your plant to be
                        swimming in soil, but rather, have a little extra room to grow into for the year ahead.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <meta charset="utf-8">
                    <p><span>Plants typically need to be repotted every 12 to 18 months, depending on how actively they
                            are growing. Some slow growers can call the same pot home for years, but will just require a
                            soil replenishment. S</span><span>pring</span><span>, before the start of the growth season,
                            is usually the best time to re-pot your houseplants.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p>If you see one or a combination of these signs, you'll know&nbsp;it's time&nbsp;to repot:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Roots are growing through the drainage hole at the bottom of the planter</li>
                        <li>Roots are pushing the plant up, out of the planter</li>
                        <li>Plant is growing slower than normal (different than winter dormancy)&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Plant is extremely top heavy, and falls over easily</li>
                        <li>Plant dries out more quickly than usual, requiring more frequent waterings</li>
                        <li>Aboveground parts of plant take up more than three times the pot space</li>
                        <li>Noticeable salt and mineral build up on the plant or planter&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here's what you'll want handy:&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your new houseplant, of course</li>
                        <li>The planter you're potting into&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Fresh&nbsp;potting mix&nbsp;</li>

                            Lava rocks<span>&nbsp;</span>or similar (if your planter does not have a drainage

                    </ul>
                    <h5>Steps to Repot&nbsp;</h5>
                    <p><strong>1. Remove plant from current pot&nbsp;</strong><br>Turn your new plant sideways, hold it
                        gently by the stems or leaves, and tap the bottom of its&nbsp;current pot until the plant slides
                        out.&nbsp;You might need to give it a bit of help with a couple gentle tugs on the base of the
                        stems.</p>
                    <p><strong> 2. Loosen the roots&nbsp;</strong><br>Loosen the plant’s roots gently with your
                        hands.&nbsp;You can prune off any threadlike roots that are extra long,&nbsp;just make sure to
                        leave the thicker&nbsp;roots at the base of the foliage. If your plant is root bound –&nbsp;the
                        roots are growing in very tight circles around the base of the plant – unbind&nbsp;the
                        roots&nbsp;as best you can and give them a trim.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Remove old potting mix&nbsp;</strong><br>Remove about one third or more of the potting
                        mix surrounding the plant. As it grew, your plant removed some of the nutrients in the current
                        mix, so you'll want to give it fresh mix if you're potting it anyway!</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Add new potting mix</strong> <br>Pour a layer of fresh potting soil into the new
                        planter and pack it down, removing any air pockets. If your new planter doesn’t have a drainage
                        hole, layer the bottom with lava rocks or similar (rocks, gravel, etc.) before adding the
                        potting mix. The goal is to create crevices for the extra water to pool into, away from your
                        plant’s roots.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Add plant</strong><br>Set your plant that you removed from the grow pot on top of the
                        fresh layer of mix in the new planter, making sure it's centered, then add potting mix around
                        the plant until it is secure. Be sure not to pack too much soil into the planter, as you want
                        the roots to breathe.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>6. Water and enjoy&nbsp;</strong><br>Even out the potting soil on top and&nbsp;water
                        well!&nbsp;It's worth noting that a freshly repotted plant does not need to be fed
                        fertilizer.&nbsp;</p>

                    <strong>Mealybugs (Pseudococcidae families)</strong><br>I'm not quite sure how mealybugs first got
                    into my home, but I first noticed them on my potato plants that I was growing in my closet garden.
                    Potatoes, particularly the leaves and stems, grow incredibly fast, so I was monitoring them pretty
                    closely. I first planted the potatoes from ones that I purchased in the farmers market and that
                    started growing "eyes". Interesting enough, I had more potatoes that began growing eyes in my fruit
                    basket, and mealybugs would just "show up" on them. Still to this day I'm befuddled by their
                    spontaneous generation.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Mealybugs are an unarmored scale insect, and I personally
                        think they are more difficult to control than the common brown scale. This is for a few reasons.
                        First is the most obvious: mealybugs move. Though its slow movement, if any plant is touching
                        another,&nbsp;there is a chance the mealybug will hitch a ride on a new leaf and spread.
                        Secondly, though their soft, cottony white appearance is quite obvious on a plant, they have a
                        tendency to hide out in the damnedest of places, like the crotch of a plant or in a leaf that
                        has yet to unfurl. Additionally, they have waxy secretions, giving them their cotton-like
                        appearance, which can serve as some basic protection. And lastly, they breed like rabbits of the
                        insect world. Females can deposit around 600 eggs in loose cottony masses, often on the
                        underside of leaves or along stems. The early instars will hatch in about a week and this often
                        causes a population explosion.</p>
                    <p>As such, it's important to get mealybug populations in
                        control. Some will toss out a plant completely, but I did no such thing. Instead I did a
                        three-pronged effort, involving the release of two beneficial insects—the <strong>green
                            lacewing</strong> (<em>Chrysoperla carnea</em>) and highly effective, aptly named
                        <strong>mealybug destroyer</strong> (<em>Cryptolaemus montrouzieri</em>), and also spot
                        treatment using a q-tip and isopropyl alcohol. Dabbing the alcohol directly onto the mealybugs
                        will easily kill them on the spot, but the upside to releasing the beneficial insects is that
                        the insects can often get to places in a plant that you often cannot get, so I believe both
                        methods—at least for me—have worked the best.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
                        <strong>Aphids (Aphidoidea&nbsp;superfamily, Aphididae family)</strong><br><p>Aphids may very well be the most commonly known unwanted houseplant pests. However, I've only ever seen aphids on the food crops that I grow in my home and never on my tropical houseplants. It may very well be a matter of preference of them, but I think what they're really looking for is that gooey sap that they get from the plant by piercing it with their mouthparts. They also exude a sticky, sweet honeydew from their rear, which often attracts other pests, like ants—or provides a medium for sooty mold to grow on, which essentially spells disaster for a plant, particularly if it's fruiting.</p><p>Aphids are a soft-bodied insect, so they're very easy to squish between your fingers, which I typically do. Like scales, aphids are also viviparous, which means they give birth to live young. Aphids are born wingless, but if you see an aphid with wings, it's a signal that the colony got too crowded and they are looking for a new houseplant for which to feed.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to get rid of aphids naturally is as follows: on a warm day, early in the morning take your infected houseplant outside and spray it vigorously with a hose. Be careful not to break the plant if it's delicate or newly growing. This can be done by spraying short, strong bursts. This should knock down the aphid population naturally. Once you're finished, inspect the plant and crush any remaining ones with your fingers. Repeatedly do the hose-spray method for another few days until you see everything is under control. If you find aphids keep on coming back despite your best hosing efforts, I would then encourage bringing in some beneficial insects, particularly <strong>green lacewing larvae</strong> or <strong>ladybird larvae</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
                        <strong>Common whitefly (<em>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</em>)</strong><br><p>At first whiteflies, which are more closely related to aphids and scale, can be mistaken for little white moths or even mealybugs. Unlike their fellow pesky counterparts, they will easily take flight if you disturb them. I first noticed whiteflies in my home when I started growing potatoes indoors (I mean seriously, potatoes indoors brought every pest imaginable!). Whiteflies are more or less generalists when it comes to plants. I noticed that they first were congregated in small numbers on potatoes, but they soon started to alight on my elephant ear plants, which were nearby.</p><p>Adults will lay eggs while they are eating (efficient little beasts, aren't they?). Eggs will hatch in less than a week and then their nymphs, similarly to scale, will crawl a short distance, plant themselves, and suck the plant until they go into a resting stage at about the 3 week point. In about four, maybe five weeks, they begin to emerge as adults and the process repeats. As indicated, both the nymphs and adults of the whitefly use their mouthparts to suck juices from plants, which can cause leaves to yellow and fall off prematurely. Additionally, whiteflies, like aphids, exude honeydew, which becomes an attractant for sooty mold. If you allow whiteflies to multiply, then they can attack your plant enough to weaken it.&nbsp;</p><p>Whiteflies are attracted to the color yellow, so the best way to catch them is by having yellow sticky traps, blasting the leaves with short bursts of water from a hose, and also introducing a beneficial insect, like a green lacewing, ladybird beetle, or whitefly parasite (<em>Encarsia formosa</em>). All three techniques are highly recommended, in that order.&nbsp;</p>

                        <strong>Red spider mites (<em>Tetranychus </em>sp.)</strong><br><p>Mites are technically not insects but they, like insects, are Arthropods. They are probably some of the most feared of the common household insect pests, largely because they are so difficult to get rid of.</p><p>Spider mites are nearly naked to the eye. You often need a magnifying lens to spot them, or you may just notice a reddish film across the bottom of the leaves, some webbing, or even some leaf damage, which usually results in reddish-brown spots on the leaf.</p><p>Earlier in the year I was gifted an <em>Alocasia micholitaiana '</em>Frydek', which is a gorgeous velvety green alocasia. I typically always check my houseplants before bringing them indoors, which is a proactive way to make sure no pesky insects are in tow, but you can't always rely on eyesight. Within about three weeks, I noticed some webbing and the start of brown dots on some of the mature leaves. Before mites could spread to the other plants, I took the <em>Alocasia</em> and washed it thoroughly in the shower and made sure the humidifier was on daily. Mites prefer dry conditions, so keeping the air humid and the plant on the wet side (something an <em>Alocasia</em> prefers anyway), was able to save the plant, although it still bears the battle wounds of the mites.</p><p>Spider mites also have a range of natural predators, including other mites like <em>Phytoseiulus</em> sp. and generalist predators like <strong>minute pirate bugs</strong> and <strong>lacewing larvae</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
